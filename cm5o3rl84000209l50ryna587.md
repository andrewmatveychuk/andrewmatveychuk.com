A while ago, I wrote about [how I run my blog](https://andrewmatveychuk.com/how-i-run-my-blog) with a self-hosted Ghost engine. Even though most processes were running on autopilot, they still required periodic attention and maintenance: the Ghost engine required updates, the blog theme needed to be fixed to be compatible with new engine versions, [the DigitalOcean droplet hosting the blog](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/ghost) demanded patching, and so on. The most annoying part was probably rebooting and troubleshooting the server when the site went down, which started to happen every two to four weeks.

A lot has changed since then, and I decided that it would be the right time to eliminate the administrative overhead of managing the underlying infrastructure. The [pricing for Ghost(Pro)](https://ghost.org/pricing/) became more attractive and comparable with other cheaper self-hosting options. Plus, I’m not very fond of spending time on something that is not of interest or a focus area for me.

Having said that, please expect the following changes:

* No [Facebook Comments](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/comments) anymore. I regret choosing them over other solutions back then, as they happened to be very clunky, error-prone and practically unsupported by Facebook.  
    I’m sticking to the native [Ghost Comments](https://ghost.org/changelog/native-comments/) as of now.
    
* I’m abandoning the email newsletters via [RSS, Zapier and Mailchimp](https://andrewmatveychuk.com/how-to-fix-images-width-for-microsoft-outlook-in-mailchimp-rss-campaigns-sourced-from-ghost). Although the related process worked very well, and the email campaigns worked just fine, I don’t see much value in keeping such a complex setup. As most of my blog visitors come from other sources, [the native email newsletters in Ghost](https://ghost.org/docs/newsletters/) should be enough to update my subscribers on new blog posts.
    

> Please expect the changes in the newsletter design as displayed in the post image.

* [The new clean theme](https://ghost.org/themes/wave/) focuses more on the content and should improve overall readability and user experience on mobile devices.
    

Under the hood, the domain was migrated from [DNSimple](https://dnsimple.com/) to [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/), and [the Cloudflare CDN](https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn/) was turned off as [Ghost(Pro) manages the CDN](https://ghost.org/help/cdn-provider-support/). The hosting also handles the TLS encryption.

So, now I will spend less time “running” my blog and more time publishing new content 😊
