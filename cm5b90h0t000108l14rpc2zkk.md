Automation is often considered to be a holy grail of technical DevOps practices: build automation, test automation, deployment automation, automation of infrastructure provisioning – all these aspects of DevOps methodology promote the elimination of manual labor at different stages of application development. [PowerShell](https://github.com/powershell), as a technology and as a scripting language, has a close association with automation and has become a de facto standard for implementing automation scenarios on the Windows platform; with the transition of PowerShell to the .NET Core framework, it is also gaining popularity in Linux world. Overall, PowerShell is a really powerful tool in experienced hands.

Unfortunately, despite the wide usage of PowerShell by DevOps practitioners, most automation solutions I come across in organizations are implemented in a quick & dirty way: no modularization, long scripts with hundreds of lines of messy code, no versioning, testing, documentation, etc. It is a paradox that automation with PowerShell, as a cornerstone for many other DevOps practices, often completely ignores the practices DevOps encourages to use. Doesn’t it seem contradictory that automation engineers ([I prefer to avoid the term ‘DevOps engineer’ as misleading](https://andrewmatveychuk.com/whats-wrong-with-devops)) who should promote the usage of DevOps practices in an organization don’t follow those principles in their own work?

No wonder that in such cases, these engineers might find it hard to convince their teammates to “implement DevOps.” I believe that the best way to persuade somebody of your righteousness is to lead by example. So, let’s make a short overview of some common DevOps practices and how you can implement them in your PowerShell scripting.

## Version control

The most common PowerShell automation solutions regular engineers use are scripts and script modules. From the technical point of view, they are plain text files with ‘ps1’ and ‘psm1’ extensions that can be tracked for changes as any other source code with [Git](https://git-scm.com/), for example. You can commit your changes, keep their history, create branches for feature development and literally do all the stuff that developers would do with a code in a source control repository.

With more advanced automation scenarios, you might find yourself creating custom PowerShell modules, creating your own toolkits and writing [Azure Automation runbooks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/automation-runbook-types#powershell-runbooks). The codebase of your initial automation add-on might become a separate project on its own with its development guidelines. Depending on your requirements, you can implement different branching strategies, use branch policies, adopt working with pull requests to merge changes in a master branch and so on. Such managed source control solutions as [Azure Repos](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/get-started/what-is-repos) or [GitHub](https://github.com) will work fine for you.

Some might argue that if you are the only author of that code and have used it only once or twice, there is no reason to bother yourself with version control. However, I doubt that you know for sure who else will be using this script in the future or how it will evolve. Tomorrow, you will also hardly remember all the changes you made to the code half a year ago. Even if it is a tiny one-liner script for a small task, it is always better to have it version-controlled than not.

## Test automation

To my surprise, I still encounter software development projects where the developers don’t use test automation and solely rely on manual checklists. The arguments they use against writing tests for their code range from hilarious, “we write code without bugs,” to completely silly, “writing tests is a waste of time.” So, if you want to demonstrate to those people why it’s essential to test your code before shipping it in production, you should start testing your own PowerShell stuff.

For example, the PowerShell team itself maintains [an extensive set of tests to verify their codebase](https://powershell.visualstudio.com/PowerShell/_test/analytics?definitionId=19&contextType=build). To create those tests, they mostly use [Pester](https://github.com/Pester/Pester) - the most known and widely used mocking and test framework for PowerShell. With Pester, you can implement unit, integration, acceptance and infrastructure testing and even describe your business test cases in [Gherkin](https://powershellexplained.com/2017-04-30-Powershell-Gherkin-advanced-features/).

Alongside testing your PowerShell code, Pester can also help you understand how much of your code is covered by tests, i.e., perform a [code coverage analysis](https://pester.dev/docs/usage/code-coverage) so you can see what commands weren’t executed during the test runs. Having these results in hand, it is possible to implement quality gates in your build process so that the build will automatically fail if the overall code coverage percentage drops below a certain acceptable level.

The results of test executions and code coverage analysis can be saved to files and published as pipeline artifacts in your CI tool. For example, in Azure Pipelines, you can use the [Publish Test Results task](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/test/publish-test-results) to publish Pester output for test results in [NUnit format](https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Test-Result-XML-Format) and the [Publish Code Coverage Results task](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/test/publish-code-coverage-results) for Pester code coverage results in [JoCoCo format](https://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/).

## Code quality analysis

Following defined coding standards in your software project lays the foundation for readable and maintainable code. Tools such as [static code analyzers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis) can help you enforce specific coding rules, track code complexity, verify your code for possible logical and security issues, avoid common pitfalls and encourage you to use best coding practices for the programming language of your choice.

In the PowerShell world, [PSScriptAnalyzer](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer) definitely should be your friend in terms of code hygiene. In addition to [the built-in set of verification rules](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/tree/master/Rules), it also allows you to [create and use custom rules](https://mathieubuisson.github.io/create-custom-rule-psscriptanalyzer/). You might be unaware, but even [Visual Studio Code, with its PowerShell extension, uses PSScriptAnalyzer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/powershell#_psscriptanalyzer) in the background to analyze your PowerShell scripts.

As PSScriptAnalyzer itself [doesn’t support outputting results in standard test framework formats](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/issues/672), it is a [common practice to wrap it into Pester tests to get formatted results](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/scripting/psscriptanalyzer-deep-dive-part-3-of-4/) that can be published in a build pipeline. For example, I prefer to create a separate Pester test at the project level to verify all PowerShell script and module definitions in my project against PSScriptAnalyzer rules.

## Build automation

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1734681921691/b8d279b8-a9f4-443f-a53f-4ca3aa16ee86.png align="center")

Even if your automation solution consists only of one PowerShell script, it is much better to test and verify it after each change in its source code than just running that script in production and discovering that it deleted some critical data or rebooted the wrong servers. When your project has a few PowerShell modules with dozens of functions, the manual overhead for running individual tests, assembling the modules, versioning them, generating documentation, etc., grows tenfold.

The [automation of the build process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_automation) is probably one of the earliest practices in software development – you know, programmers are lazy folks, and they get bored with repetitive tasks very soon. So, when creating your PowerShell projects, you also might want to consider automating some build tasks.

Instead of writing custom build scripts, look at tools like [InvokeBuild](https://github.com/nightroman/Invoke-Build) or [psake](https://github.com/psake/psake). They can help you to automate the individual steps of your build process, define dependencies and build your solution with one command invocation.

## Package management

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1734681922291/7a695500-5294-4b72-a284-a3f296dbe1fe.png align="center")

As you might already know, PowerShell allows you to pack your custom scripts in modules to make them distributable. The core idea of PowerShell is to enable you to create reusable tools that can be used in the pipeline independently of the context. However, when creating your scripts and functions, you likely want to utilize existing cmdlets so as not to reinvent the wheel. Doing so inevitably introduces dependency in your code from external modules that might not be shipped by default with PowerShell installation.

When developing locally, it might not be a big deal to manually install those modules and other dependencies once and run the builds. When using a build service, such as Azure Pipelines, for example, your build process will be run on a build agent that might be different on each run, especially if you use hosted agents. So, how can we define the dependencies for our PowerShell project and make them present in a build environment? The answer is simple — use a [package manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager).

The idea of automation package management is not new, and almost any operating and programming environment has some kind of package management tool like NPM for Node.js or RPM for many Linux-based distributions. PowerShell, as a platform, also has a reach [toolkit for working with packages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/packagemanagement/), but sometimes, it might be tedious to script all those commands in your build script. Instead, you can use [PSDepend](https://github.com/RamblingCookieMonster/PSDepend) module and [define project dependencies in a simple PowerShell data file](https://github.com/RamblingCookieMonster/PSDepend#defining-dependencies). This will make your dependency management much cleaner and easier to maintain.

## Documentation generation

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1734681922885/87dc85ed-3cb1-4892-b533-050943b92e48.png align="center")

Documentation is an essential part of every software or hardware solution. It helps other people to better and quicker understand the behavior of a system and what to expect from it. The idea of keeping your documentation close to code was beautifully implemented in PowerShell with comment-based help. It makes the process of writing and updating documentation for engineers more convenient than keeping it in external files. On the contrary, reading that documentation in the source code or in a PowerShell console might not be so handy, particularly for non-PowerShell people, as browsing web-based documents. Keeping and updating documentation in a few places can bring more trouble than it is worth.

To overcome that challenge, you can automate the process of creating human-readable documentation from your code-based help with [PlatyPS](https://github.com/PowerShell/platyPS). This tool generates documentation in Markdown format to be published on the web. You can also include it as a build step in your build script or pipeline and have your documentation always up to date. For example, [Microsoft uses it](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/it-resources-training-blog/how-microsoft-used-platyps-to-evergreen-and-open-source-office/ba-p/179949) to create help content for thousands of its cmdlets. So, learn it, use it and people working with your PowerShell solutions will be grateful for its high-quality documentation.

## Continuous integration & Deployment automation

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1734681923557/429cb8bd-cd34-447b-851a-fb7c3636360b.png align="center")

Conceptually, you can think of continuous integration as of evolution of the build automation process. When build automation is more of a helper for building your solution locally in some environment, continuous integration raises that bar and automatically tries to build and test the solution after each change (commit) to it.

It would be really strange if we couldn’t implement this one core practice in our PowerShell coding because PowerShell is no different from other programming languages in terms of creating CI pipelines for it. For instance, you can use [Azure Pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/what-is-azure-pipelines) to configure CI and CD processes for your PowerShell project, which can be an individual script or a module. Azure Pipelines can run [PowerShell tasks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/utility/powershell), which could be a script file in your repository or just an inline script in the task definition on the build agents. Apart from that generic task, you can also execute your scripts directly in an Azure environment with the [Azure PowerShell task](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/deploy/azure-powershell).

For example, you can define the details of your build steps in a build script, like tasks in [InvokeBuild](https://github.com/nightroman/Invoke-Build) or [psake](https://github.com/psake/psake), and invoke those specific tasks in your pipeline in a particular order: build, test, deploy, etc.

The same is true regarding deployment automation. Depending on your requirements and environment, you can copy the resulting scripts or modules to target servers, upload them to automation services such as Azure Automation accounts or publish them to some artifact repository for further consumption by other processes and people.

## Artifact management

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1734681924143/8b22000f-0a5d-4f9b-af04-4d83e2f7bf98.png align="center")

In more advanced automation scenarios, instead of putting all the logic in a single PowerShell script, you might want to make it more reusable and modular. For example, you might create PowerShell modules so that individual functions can be reused as cmdlets in a control script(s) that implement business logic itself.

If you work with PowerShell long enough, it is highly likely that you are already using such an artifact repository as [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/). It hosts most of the PowerShell modules as well as individual scripts that you might need for your automation. Technically, that repository is just a NuGet feed that contains NuGet packages.

With [Azure Artifacts](https://docs.microsoft.com/ru-ru/azure/devops/artifacts/index), you can create your own private or [public feed](https://docs.microsoft.com/ru-ru/azure/devops/artifacts/tutorials/share-packages-publicly) and publish the results of your build process as a reusable package. The [NuGet task](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/package/nuget) supports multiple options for working with NuGet packages, so you can both create a package and publish it to an artifact’s feed and basically [create your own PowerShell repository](https://docs.microsoft.com/ru-ru/azure/devops/artifacts/tutorials/private-powershell-library).

As you can see now, when working with PowerShell automation solutions, you can and should embrace the same DevOps practices as any other software development project would use. Doing so, you will find it much easier to promote DevOps in your team and organization.

Keep learning and trying new things. I hope that after reading this, you will see your PowerShell scripting from a different perspective!
