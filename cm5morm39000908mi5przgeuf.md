Next week, on April 29, 2020, I will be doing a demo on the webinar held by [Infopulse](https://www.linkedin.com/company/infopulse/), an outsourcing company that is part of the [TietoEVRY](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tietoevry/) group. This webinar will be dedicated to using Azure DevOps services to achieve maximum business value in common and some specialized cases.

My demo will be based on a sample project for [developing PowerShell solutions](https://andrewmatveychuk.com/a-sample-ci-cd-pipeline-for-powershell-module) and [using Azure DevOps to govern Azure subscriptions](https://andrewmatveychuk.com/how-to-deploy-azure-policy-from-an-azure-devops-pipeline).

The source code for these demo projects is available on GitHub at the following links:

* [powershell.sample-module](https://github.com/andrewmatveychuk/powershell.sample-module)
    
* [azure.policy](https://github.com/andrewmatveychuk/azure.policy)
