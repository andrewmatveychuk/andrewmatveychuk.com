I recently presented on a webinar hosted by the [Turbo360](https://turbo360.com/webinar/optimizing-compute-costs-in-azure) team and [Michael Stephenson](https://mikestephenson.me/), the host of [Azure on Air](https://turbo360.com/podcast/category/azure-on-air) and [FinOps o](https://turbo360.com/podcast/category/finops-on-azure)[n Azure](https://turbo360.com/podcast/category/azure-on-air) podcasts. There, we discussed the most common mistakes in optimizing compute costs in Azure and how to avoid them, the challenges of cost optimization at enterprise scale and how to address them with proper monitoring, automation and capacity management strategies. Additionally, we explored the hidden downsides of cost overoptimization, which can negatively impact the availability and security of your Azure applications.

If you missed it, please feel free to catch up on that topic by watching the webinar recording:
